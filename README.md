# all the graphs were taken from recharts library.

# we can also use material ui for the charts 

# material ui has been used in users page

# both the recharts and material ui needs to be installed beforehand from the powershell(terminal) by npm i recharts, npm install @mui/x-data-grid and npm install @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled.

# then we can run npm run dev
